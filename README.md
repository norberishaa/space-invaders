# Space-Invaders-Game

## Introduction
A Space Invaders game implemented in Python using the Pygame library.

In this game, the player controls a spaceship to shoot down rocks falling from the sky. The objective is to survive as long as possible by avoiding collisions with the rocks and shooting them down to earn points.

## How to play?
Use the arrow keys to move the spaceship: 
- **A**: Move the spaceship to the left.
- **D**: Move the spaceship to the right.
- **W**: Move the spaceship upwards.
- **S**: Move the spaceship downwards.

Press the **spacebar ‚ê£** to shoot bullets towards the rocks falling from above.

Your score is displayed at the center of the screen, and the remaining lives are shown at the top of the screen.

## Requirements
Ensure you have **Python** installed on your system. Install the Pygame library by running the following command:

```
pip install pygame
```

## Parameter tweaks
You can adjust certain parameters in the code to customize your gameplay experience:

- **FPS (Frames per Second)**: Modify the `FPS` variable to change the speed at which the game runs. Increasing this parameter will make the game faster.
- **Velocity (VEL)**: Adjust the `VEL` variable to change the speed of the spaceship's movement. Increasing this parameter will make the spaceship move faster.
- **Bullet Velocity (BULLET_VEL)**: Change the `BULLET_VEL` variable to alter the speed of the bullets fired by the spaceship. Increasing this parameter will make the bullets travel faster.

Other parameters such as image sizes and positions are not recommended to be altered unless necessary.

## Enjoy the game!
Challenge yourself to achieve the highest score while dodging rocks and mastering the controls of your spaceship. Have fun playing Space Invaders!
